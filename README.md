&emsp;&emsp;The app vividly shows users the history, production process of traditional Chinese culture: sugar painting. And through the use of AR leapmotion technology will be the user's hand movements into the game operation, the user immersed in the production process of sugar painting, in the production of a more in-depth understanding of the history of sugar painting culture and related knowledge.  
&emsp;&emsp;We selected the theme colour of the project by taking it from traditional Chinese culture. At the same time, after a series of background research, we combined the gameplay with the equipment. Through AR and leapmotion to provide players with a more realistic experience. The specific gameplay is as follows: Players first turn the dial. The dial corresponds to different Zodiac sketches, and the player needs to draw different patterns according to the requirements. In order to simplify the process, we will display the rough outline of the pattern on the panel. Players only need to trace the pattern.  
&emsp;&emsp;Players can also use AR technology to view models of sugar shops, sugar paintings and more. At the same time, players can also better understand the culture of sugar painting through the in-game science and technology.
